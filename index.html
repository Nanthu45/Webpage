        <div id="para"><p>The estimated 2.2 million inhabitants of Paris are all very proud to be Parisian, and so they should be. Which city has been more romanticized in literature and film? In fact there are 65 films (and counting) that star the Eiffel Tower as a significant feature. And that's just a small fraction of the number of films that merely feature the Eiffel Tower either as a symbol of French or European lifestyle or as an example of something beautiful.
         Despite its long, and often blood splattered history, Paris still retains the title of the most romantic city in the world. With the majestic sweeping boulevards and the regal architecture, it is hard not to be enchanted and seduced by this mysterious, copacetic city.</p>
